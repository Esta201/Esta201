## Hi, I’m Earlene!

I’m a <b> fourth year computer systems engineering student </b> with an interest in C/C++ programming for embedded systmes, FPGA application acceleration using processor/ASP co-design, and high-level Python development.

My final-year project is on hardware acceleration for Capsule Networks, a relatively new neural network model that aims to mitigate the information loss in CNN pooling layers by using multi-dimensional vectors to encode feature information. By using Xilinx's new Vits AI toolkit, we're looking to examine a) the extent of acceleration possible given the current toolset and b) avenues for further, custom HDL acceleration. The target deployment board is the UltraScale+ MPSOC ZCU102.

## Notable work: 
- Developed HDL FIR filter for integration with Audio Effects HMPSOC on Altera Cyclone IV
- Created Java CNN model from scratch for MNIST and accelerated it using Java threading framework + SIMD instructions(~2x speedup)
- Programmed multi-model (CNN/MLP) hand-written number recognition tool in Python using PyQt and Pytorch back-end 
- Developed the motor driver embedded code for a wirelessly powered RC car
- Programmed a chess game (C++) using OOP concepts
- Designed a smart energy monitor using Altium, Proteus, Atmel Studio (IDE), and an Atmega328PB
- Created a Java Android-based application that displays electrical components
- Designed a flappy bird game in VHDL for Altera Cyclone IV

Languages: <b> C/C++, Python, Matlab, VHDL </b>
